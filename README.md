# Open Climb
OpenClimb is designed to provide tools for visually impaired people who want to try climbing or are looking for more independence 
when practicing the sport indoors.

## Main features

### Colorblind mode
When climbing indoors, climbers usually find routes that can be distinguished through colors. 
However this can become problematic for colorblind people, so the first tool is designed to help distinguish different colored routes.

### Guide mode
In real competitions, people with low vision or blind people are allowed to climb with a guide that can only lead them by telling them the positions of 
each hold. Thus, this mode aims to provide them with independence when training, providing audio descriptions according to their body positions and detected holds.

## Tech used
